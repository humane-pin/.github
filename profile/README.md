# Humane AI Pin Aftermarket Development/Revival

![humane-pin-revival](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3907c5dc-7520-4b98-add2-7e6c17fef725)

This initiative aims to restore functionality to the Humane AI Pin, which became inoperative after Humane Inc. discontinued its servers and AI services. By developing alternative solutions and providing documentation, I hope to enable AI Pin owners to continue using their devices after-all Ai Pin is just unique Android device!

**Disclaimer:** This project is an independent effort and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Humane Inc.

## Why This Initiative Exists

In February 2025, Humane Inc. discontinued support for the AI Pin, deactivating servers and deleting user data, which effectively incapacitated the device. This left many users with non-functional hardware. This org is my effort to bring pin back to life.

## Disclaimer

This organization is an independent, community-led effort and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Humane Inc. in any official capacity. All projects and initiatives undertaken are for educational and developmental purposes, aiming to support users who wish to continue utilizing their AI Pins despite the cessation of official services.

## Note: 

I don’t have the actual hardware yet—it’s difficult to find in my country. It’s sad to see such an innovative device die, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. If you can help me get my hands on the hardware, please reach out on my email - techyminati@outlook.com or on my [X/Twitter](https://x.com/techyminati)
